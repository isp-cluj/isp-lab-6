# Implement the following exercises

In this lab you will create small Java applications by using as reference an UML class diagram. Please consider following general notes before start implementing:
- toString() method when required will return a string like *ClassName{attributeName1=attributeValue1,...,attributeNamen=attributeValuen}*.
- Do not reuse (import) the same class in multiple exercises. **Each exercise is standalone and should be resolved in its package.**

## Exercise 1
![Exercise 1 image](docs/ex1.jpg)

Given the UML class diagram above, implement the corresponding Java program.

1. Create Java class based on the diagram above. 
    * _PreventiveMeasures_ should offer comparing possibility by implementing ```Comparable<PreventiveMeasures>```
    * _Country_ should offer comparing possibility using ```Comparator<Country>```
2. Demonstrate the functionality of application in Exercise1 class main method.
3. Create minimal unit tests for testing the behavior of the program.

**Note 1: Constructors and setter\getter methods are not represented in the diagram but can\should be implemented."**

**Note 2: You can add any extra methods if required.**
